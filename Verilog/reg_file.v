/*
	Register File 

	Register File consists of 32 Ã— 32-bit registers	

	bus_a and bus_b: 32-bit output busses for reading 2 registers
	bus_w: 32-bit input bus for writing a register when we is 1
	Two registers read and one written in a cycle

	reg_a selects register to be read on bus_a
	reg_b selects register to be read on bus_b
	reg_w selects the register to be written

	The clock input is used only during write operation
	During read, register file behaves as a combinational logic block
